    "### Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening. \n",
    "The `open()` function is used to open a file in Python. It takes the file path as a parameter and returns a file object that can be used to perform various operations on the file. The `open()` function can be used with different modes to specify the purpose of opening the file. The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'`: Read mode. Opens the file for reading. This is the default mode if no mode is specified. If the file does not exist, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError` exception.\n",
    "- `'w'`: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "- `'a'`: Append mode. Opens the file for appending. The file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "- `'x'`: Exclusive creation mode. Opens a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, it raises a `FileExistsError` exception.\n",
    "- `'b'`: Binary mode. Opens the file in binary mode, allowing binary data to be read or written. This mode can be used in combination with other modes.\n",
    "- `'t'`: Text mode. Opens the file in text mode, allowing text data to be read or written. This mode can be used in combination with other modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2.Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "The `close()` function is used to close a file in Python. It is important to close a file after you have finished using it because it releases the system resources associated with the file. When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations. If the file is not closed properly, these resources may not be released until the program terminates, which can lead to resource leaks and other issues. By explicitly calling the `close()` function, you ensure that the file is properly closed and the resources are released immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file.\n",
    "Here's a Python program that creates a text file, writes a specific sentence, closes the file, and then reads its content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a text file and write a sentence\n",
    "file = open('sample.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('I want to become a Data Scientist')\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode and read its content\n",
    "file = open('sample.txt', 'r')\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This program creates a file named 'sample.txt', writes the sentence 'I want to become a Data Scientist' to it, closes the file, opens it again in read mode, reads its content using the `read()` function, and finally prints the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4.Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().\n",
    "In Python, the file object provides several methods for reading the contents of a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `read()` method reads the entire content of a file as a single string. If no argument is specified, it reads the entire file. For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  file = open('sample.txt', 'r')\n",
    "  content = file.read()\n",
    "  file.close()\n",
    "  print(content)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `readline()` method reads a single line from a file. Each subsequent call to `readline()` returns the next line. For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  file = open('sample.txt', 'r')\n",
    "  line1 = file.readline()\n",
    "  line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "  file.close()\n",
    "  print(line1)\n",
    "  print(line2)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `readlines()` method reads all the lines of a file and returns them as a list of strings. Each line in the file becomes an element in the list. For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  file\n",
    "\n",
    " = open('sample.txt', 'r')\n",
    "  lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "  file.close()\n",
    "  print(lines)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together?\n",
    "The `with` statement in Python is used with the `open()` function to ensure that the file is automatically closed after it's no longer needed. It provides a more convenient and safer way to handle files, especially when dealing with exceptions or errors. The advantage of using the `with` statement with `open()` is that it takes care of closing the file automatically, even if an exception occurs within the block. It eliminates the need to explicitly call the `close()` function and reduces the risk of resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using the `with` statement with `open()`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    # Perform operations with the file\n",
    "\n",
    "# The file is automatically closed at the end of the `with` block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6.  Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "The `write()` function example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "file = open('sample.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('Hello, world!\\n')\n",
    "file.write('This is a sample file.')\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `write()` function is used to write two separate strings to the file 'sample.txt'. The '\\n' is added to create a new line after the first string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `writelines()` function is used to write multiple strings to a file. It takes an iterable (such as a list or tuple) of strings as an argument and writes each string to the file. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lines = ['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n', 'Line 3\\n']\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open('sample.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `writelines()` function writes each string from the `lines` list to the file 'sample.txt'. The '\\n' is added at the end of each string to create new lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `write()` and `writelines()` functions do not automatically add a new line character at the end of the string. If you want to add a new line, you need to explicitly include the '\\n' character in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when using the `write()` or `writelines()` functions in write mode ('w'), the existing content of the file will be overwritten. If you want to append new content to an existing file, you can use append mode ('a') instead."
